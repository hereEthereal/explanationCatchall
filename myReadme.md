Binary Search:

I'd be happy to explain binary search in simple terms.
Imagine you're looking for a word in a dictionary. You could start at the beginning and flip through every page until you find it. But that would take a long time, right?
Binary search is like a smarter way to find the word:

You open the dictionary right in the middle.
You check if the word you're looking for comes before or after that middle page.
If it comes before, you only look at the first half of the dictionary. If it comes after, you only look at the second half.
You keep repeating this process - opening the remaining section in the middle and choosing which half to keep - until you find your word.

This method is much faster because each time you look, you cut the remaining pages in half. Even in a huge dictionary, you'd find your word in just a few steps.
That's essentially what binary search does with sorted lists of data in computers. It keeps dividing the search area in half until it finds what it's looking for, making it much quicker than checking every single item one by one.
