Summary of Current Concept:

We're designing a simulated environment to evolve complex, collaborative behaviors in simple entities. The key components are:

Entity Nexus (EN): A special area that rewards energy collection.

Executive Coordinator (EC): Located in the EN, it can send signals and distribute rewards.

Entity Movers (EM): Mobile entities that can move, they can move other entities as well as energy.

Entity Conduits (EC): Stationary entities that can route energy, they move directionally and they have a switch that determine the From to To direction that they move the energy.

Entity Converters (ECv): Convert raw energy to usable energy.

The environment spawns raw energy that moves like light. This energy can be converted and then transported. The goal is to bring energy to the Energy Nexus, with higher rewards for delivering directly to the Executive Coordinator.

Main Goals:

Evolve Collaborative Behavior: Develop a system where simple entities learn to work together to efficiently collect and transport energy.

Emergent Strategies: Allow for the evolution of complex strategies without explicitly programming them.

Balanced Reward System: Create a nuanced reward structure that encourages both broad energy collection and precise delivery.

Adaptive Decision Making: Evolve entities that can make decisions based on signals from the EC and local conditions.

Efficient Energy Management: Develop a system that efficiently detects, converts, and transports energy across the environment.

Scalable Complexity: Start with simple behaviors and allow for increasing complexity over time.

The overarching aim is to observe how these simple entities might evolve to form complex, efficient "organisms" or systems for energy management, mimicking in some ways the evolution of biological systems but with the unique constraints and opportunities of our simulated environment.
