can we control the tension between nodes in cytoscape? it could be cool to make shapes using this method.


Common Graph Algorithms:
a) Traversal Algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores a graph level by level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores a graph by going as deep as possible before backtracking.

b) Shortest Path Algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Can handle negative edge weights and detect negative cycles.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

c) Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:

Kruskal's Algorithm: Builds a minimum spanning tree by adding the smallest edge that doesn't create a cycle.
Prim's Algorithm: Grows a minimum spanning tree from a starting vertex.

d) Other Important Algorithms:

Topological Sorting: Orders vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every edge (u, v), u comes before v.
Strongly Connected Components: Finds maximal strongly connected subgraphs in a directed graph.
