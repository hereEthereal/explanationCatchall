our goal is to implement educational apps in the STEM realm that visualize and show the working of algorithms, math, functions clearly simply and insightfully. The step button is a core concept and if appropriate for the given education is used. the learner will click through the app with the step button so they can learn the concept one step at a time.

we prefer using react with ts and relevant libs

each should be a single file as a component to be used with a pre-existing app

please propose a plan / prompt / goal / outline for:



Euclidean Algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor
Basic Matrix Operations
Simple Harmonic Motion
Basic Logic Gates and Boolean Operations
Linked List Operations
